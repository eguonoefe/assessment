# Encourage Others

### Expectation
The Developer is able to give others support, confidence and hope. They can constructively persuade and stimulate others to continue something with strong work ethics. They show appreciation for the contributions of others, and give others credit for their work.

### Justification
I believe team work is the key to a successful project and to ensure people contribute their best, there has to be total individual commitment. We as a team have the culture of encouraging team members by 

1. Publicly recognizing efforts and contributions to any feature been demoed during team meetings, no matter how small the contributions are. 
2. Showing appreciation for their feedback.
3. Taking team members on a timeout to relax, engage with them and discuss about their contributions to the project.
