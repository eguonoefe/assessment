# Accountability

### Expectation
The Developer guides others on the team about the importance of taking responsibility and accounting for one's actions.

### Justification
I encourage team members to take ownership of the project by taking full responsiblity of tasks they work on. I encourage them to own up when mistakes are made as this adds more positivity to the team such as:
1. Aid collaborative effort towards making it right.
2. makes them more trustable.
3. makes them learn, improve and grow.
4. makes them more reliable and better still greater leaders.
