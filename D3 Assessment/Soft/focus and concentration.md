# Focus & Concentration

### Expectation
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of the team and knows how to keep his team focused on the client's top priorities but also knows when to stop pushing to avoid team or individual burnout.

### Justification
I believe it is absolutely important to keep focus and concentration while working on a project which is why I usually take breaks inbetween my work hours. I tend to also take short breaks whenever I notice I am taking a longer than usual to understand or resolve somethings I have done before or somethings I have evaluated to take less effort. Also, when I feel I am experiencing burnout, I communicate to the necessary stakeholders and take paid leave.

Also, in order to ensure the team as a whole stay focus and concentrated on projects, I have random conversation about the project with my teammates so as to understand their perspective, mindset and how focused they are on the project. Whenever I notice a shift in concentration, I encourage them, advice them to take a short time break and motivate them by making them iterate over the reason they joined the project and their responsibility as a developer; but when I notice a burnout, I suggest a paid leave for them.
