# Adaptability

### Expectation
The Developer is able to help other members of their team adapt to change and recognise its value.

### Justification
On my current engagement, I worked with a junior developer who spent 3 months on the project and part of the on boarding requirement involved having a sync with him where I took him through the project infrastructure and architecture, the different stacks being made use of, what is expected of him, how to create tickets, current workflow practices and how he could in turn add value to himself and the project. 

During the first set of weeks, I constantly review his pull requests, offering feedback in ways which I feel he could improve upon and in so doing adapt to the project and itâ€™s intricacies. This ensured that times which he felt uncomfortable about his own implementation, he could easily reach out to me and I try to offer pointers on how he could improve his implementation and understand the project better.
