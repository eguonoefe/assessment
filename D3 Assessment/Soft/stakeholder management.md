# Stakeholder Management

### Expectation
The Developer includes junior members of their team as stakeholders and understands how to appropriately communicate the right level of information to them.

### Justification
I have actively portrayed this skill on my current engagement at a time when I worked on a project with a junior python developer remotely. Despite the time frame for the junior developer on the project was for three months, I was successfully able to manage, integrate him into the team seamlessly and ensure he is setup for success. Almost all the time, I believe it was a daily routine to convey discussion topics and concerns which the project manager or any other senior team member had with our project to him.

I have added some screenshots to show evidence of this.
