# Leadership

### Expectation
The Developer demonstrates additional leadership skills such as imparting knowledge and expertise to their team, helping them to understand what needs to be built and why, and encouraging a collaborative environment.


### Justification
Based on the size of the development team on my current engagement, I have been charged with the responsibility of leading the development of two services, one built with ruby on rails and the other with python/flask. As the only python developer on the engagement, the responsibilty has given me the opportunity to provide technical guidance, impart my skill set to the rest of the team and encourging them towards achieving the team goal.

Also, I served as a Learning Facilator Assistant on several occassions, and during those periods, I was able to guide different people with different experience and skill set, motivating and making sure they all improve in both their tech and soft skills.
