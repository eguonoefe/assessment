# Expectations Management

### Expectation
The Developer is able to manage the expectations of others regarding the output of the team as a whole and of individual members. They are also able to manage the expectations of the team themselves.

### Justification
I have on several occasions on my current engagement displayed this skill in the following areas:


1. I am constantly verbal about blockers which I or those in my team face. I vividly state what issue I am facing and proposed steps which I have taken to resolve these issues.
2. I am very open to reworking an issue when feedback is given on how it should properly work or in the case where ticket requirements were not made clear enough or users give feedback after interacting with the feature.
3. I constantly contribute to retrospectives and give constructive feedback and concerns on my views to our progress, motivation and development workflow.
4. I raise concerns especially when set requirements on a tasks are vague or not visually achievable early enough to ensure that it doesnâ€™t have any serious impact on the team outputs.

An example is we got a data science related task which involves cleaning dataset and importing them into mongodb using python.  While working on the task, we noticed the dataset we were given had inconsistent data structure and missing values. I notified my CTO about the issue as this will affect our timeline of delivery. We re-evaluated the timeline of delivery of the task  along with the CTO and proffered a solution of using a library know as pandas to build a consistent structure for the dataset and set default values for the missing values pending the time a new dataset is gotten.
