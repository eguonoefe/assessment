# Empathy

### Expectation
The Developer is sensitive to the feelings, thoughts and experiences of people on their team. They also guide other members of their team to consider and respond appropriately to the needs and feelings of different people in different situations.

### Justification
Due to the size of the development team (2) on my current engagement and the number of services (5) which we are building, coupled with the various stacks and technologies used, and the different level of expertise on different stacks it has been quite challenging to an extent to adapt and switch between services. What has made us scale through as been the ability to guide each other as team members through the experience, feelings, thoughts and challenges.

We have been able to achieve this by
1.  Being always eager to pay attention and listen to others.
2.  Rendering assistance when team mates are faced with blockers.
3.  Giving ASK feedback to team mates.
4.  Being open to team mates which aids in getting to understand them more.
