# Team Dynamics

### Expectation
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of a team and how they are responsible not only for their own individual contributions, but mentoring other team members to increase the overall effectiveness of the team.

### Justification
Based on the small size of the develpment team on my current engagement and the expectation to be able to switch between stacks and technologies used, we as teammates constantly take responsiblity for each others contributions.

As the most experience python developer on the engagement and the lead developer on our properties service, I take responsiblity to understand other team mates, their roles in relation to their contribution to the service, what is expected from them and their level of expertise. This has better aided the team as regards better communication, individual responsibility identification, better task delegation, and overall team effectiveness.
