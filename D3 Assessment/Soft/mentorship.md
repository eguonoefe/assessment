# Mentorship

### Expectation
The Developer demonstrates an ability to coach knowledge-seeking developers in best practices in a manner that helps the mentee accelerate their knowledge and growth.

### Justification

As a learning facilitator assistant at several bootcamps, I have been priviledged to offer mentorship and guidance to aspiring developers. Also after completing my apprenticeship from VOF, I offered mentorship to fellows on apprenticeship who were placed on VOF.

Also on my current engagement, I have demonstrated this skill by mentoring junior developers on my team. I have pair programming with them when they are faced with blockers, where I also  seize the opportunity to ensure they follow the  engineering best practices of the team, observe their thought process and give feedback where necessary.
