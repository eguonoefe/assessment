# Self Awareness

### Expectation
The Developer has a strong awareness of self and seeks feedback from others regarding their actions and behaviours. They continuously seek to improve weak areas. They make efforts to understand the behaviours of those around them, and make effective use of this understanding.

### Justification
I constantly engage in self examination and also seek feedback from both my TSM and the SC on my team on areas which I can improve on and become better at them.

One weakness I have been working on is reaching out on time when faced with blockers rather than trying to figure it out alone. With constant efforts of ensuring that I reach out immediately I spend more than 15 minutes on a particular blocker, has made me a better developer on my engagement.
