# Relationship Building

### Expectation
The Developer has the ability to establish themselves as a trusted advisor to their company. Leadership sees them as having the company's best interest at hand and capable of giving unbiased advice.

### Justification
I believe relationship building involves accepting and celebrating cultural and background differences, listening effectively which would in turn encourage good communication, stakeholder management, expectation management and product ownership.

During my partner travel, I have been able to engage in conversations with stakeholders as regards the business model, the short and long term objectives of the organization and how we intend to achieve them. Also as part of the pioneer developers, I have been integral to the planning and fleshing out of the development strategies of our product. All these has given me the opportunity to input my advice and in return gain their trust.
