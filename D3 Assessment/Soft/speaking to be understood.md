# Speaking to be Understood

### Evidence
The Developer speaks in a manner (audibility, pace) that allows others to engage and understand. They are able to rephrase a concept using different perspectives or vocabulary in order to exhibit a thorough understanding of the subject. The Developer can present important information to teams and stakeholders they interact with frequently.

### Justification

On my current engagement, I have been opportuned to enhance this skill through the follow avenues;
1. Daily standup - this is where I give daily updates regarding my currently task, explain blockers I might be facing in an audible and clear manner so that I can get unblocked and also raise concerns if any.

2. Demos - leading demos where software updates or new features are been demonstrated to and questions asked by all members of the company has afforded me the experience and opportunity to improved my ability to carry along both tech and non-tech audience when giving a talk.
