# Management

### Expectation
The Developer demonstrates an ability to manage junior members of their team by clearly setting expectations, by helping them to improve as developers through the delivery of prioritised, value-adding work, and by helping them grow as contributing members of a technical team.


### Justification
I have exhibitied  this skill over the course of my time as an Assistant Technical Team lead on VOF project during apprenticeship and currently on my engagement. I have achieved successful management of junior developers by constantly using myself and my outputs to set examples, setting expectations for them to not only improve themselves as developers but also become better leaders in their own right, adding value by taking ownership of their work and having an unbiased opinion of contributions brought in by their fellow team mates.
