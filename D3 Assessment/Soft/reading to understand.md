# Reading to Understand

### Expectation
The Developer is able to identify and convey the key points of material and content read. They are adept at reading documentation, code, or emails and deriving all required information from them.

### Justification

In most of the features and user stories I have implemented, I have had to read the User story and understand before implementing. I have also used some libraries that require reading and understanding  their documentations without which I would not have successfully implemented the features. 

An example was when I was asked to integrate mongodb with our properties service which was bulit with python using mongoengine orm. Being the first time of using the library, I had to read through it's documentation and  understand it's implementation examples before I was able to integrate and use it successfully.

Another instance was when I picked a task which required integrating an external mail service known as sendgrid into our user service for email notification. In order to successfully achieve that, I had to read the documentation of the service to understand how it works.
