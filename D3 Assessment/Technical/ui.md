# UI/UX Awareness/Design

### Expectations
The Developer should be able to assist in the creation of UI/UX designs as well as suggest improvements on existing designs.
​​
### Justification
Based on the size of the development team on my engagement which consist of just two developers, I have been immensely involved in the creation of UI/UX designs and also contributed to improvement of existing designs. I was in charge of setting and cleaning up of the react template used on our web client service.
