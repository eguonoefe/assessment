# Scoping And Estimation
### Expectation
The Developer is able to facilitate the systematic breakdown of technical work into individual tasks and provide estimates on each to ultimately derive an estimate on the Level of Effort (LOE) and the time required to complete the work.

### Justification
On my current engagement, our EPIC stories are usually set forth by our product manager, part of my work as the most experienced python developer on the team usually involves having a sync with the rest of the team to determine how to break these EPIC stories into milestones and implementable tickets as it relates to some of our services built with python. This usually entails taking into consideration what requirements are in place and those that need to be created. Estimating a ticket in my own experience is usually based on severity of the task at hand and also the level of difficulty as regards achieving the desired goal. Usually, I try as much to first research a problem before going forward to create a ticket on it. And on the ticket I try to leave as much as possible my own research findings on the problem so the person who gets to pick it wouldnâ€™t have to spend too much time deliberating on which implementation works best but would be confident enough to know that recommended approaches has already been stated on the ticket. When faced with multiple solutions to a problem, I tend to reach out to relevant stakeholders of the project and offer pros and cons on the different solutions and come to a consesus as regards the best solution to go with.
