# Decision Making

### Expectation
The Developer is able to facilitate group discussions and decision-making. They do this by controlling the flow of discussions, keeping everyone on track, ensuring that all relevant points are made and weighed as needed, and making sure the group is able to reach consensus.

### Justification
As one of the Principal Developer on my current engagement which is a startup, I've had the opportunity of facilitating numerous decision-making discussions, ranging from system architecture, database selection and design, what stack and tools to use etc. Most of the time we have a white board session where we  identify issues, make researches on them, propose solutions with their pros and cons.

During those various sessions, I ensure doing the following things;

1. Taking notes of points about what's been disussed.
2. Managing the conservation in order to ensure it doesn't turn into a debate.
3. Request each team members perspective and contribution.
4. Reconcile suggestions and contributions from all team members inorder to reach a unanimous consesus.
