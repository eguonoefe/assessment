# Project Management
### Expectation
The Developer is able to use a project management tool to effectively manage the work done by a team of developers by working with them to ensure that all tasks are identified & tracked, that changes are updated on stories, and that statuses are effectively used to keep everyone informed.

### Justification
On my current engagement, we currently use GITLAB issue tracker as our project management tool to create tickets/tasks. When creating tickets, I try to give a detailed description of the problem, acceptance criteria and also try to simplify it as much by providing possible solutions (in the case of a bug) or research links (if its a new feature or a refactor). Also, when estimating time completion for a ticket, I usually rely on my prior work experience on similar issue or on my research findings on the ticket.
Over the course of my time at Andela, I have also used various project management tools, ranging from pivotal tracker while on VOF during apprenticeship, bugzilla (with Mozilla Balrog) and Trello (during bootcamp).
