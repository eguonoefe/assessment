# Problem Solving
### Expectation:
The Developer is able to display logical reasoning by drawing inferences that can be correlated to facts gathered, and prediction by extrapolating potential outcomes of solutions to identify risks and unintended consequences.

### Justification
Being the only python developer on my current engagement, I was faced with the task to spin up a new service in python that will actively process a large dataset on properties and run some analyisis on the data in order to genrate a list of viable properties to bid on during an auction.

In order to achieve that, I had to gather information regarding how to go about this. The information gathered included;

1. which system design architecture to use.
2. what data prcessing and analysis tool or package to use.
3. how best to store the dataset (which database to use).
4. the database schema design.
5. development specification, schedules and test plans.
6. How best to document the service and which package to use.
7. which coding style and convention to follow.
