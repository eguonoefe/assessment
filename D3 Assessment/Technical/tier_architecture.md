# 2 & 3 Tier Architecture
### Expectation
The Developer has a thorough understanding of multi-tier architecture and is able to guide a team in the intricacies of its development.

### Justification
An Multi-tier (N-Tier) Application program is one that is distributed among three or more separate computers in a distributed network.

The most common form of n-tier is the 3-tier Application, and it is classified into three categories.

1. User interface programming in the user's computer
2. Business logic in a more centralized computer, and
3. Required data in a computer that manages a database.

In N-tier, "N" refers to a number of tiers or layers are being used like â€“ 2-tier, 3-tier or 4-tier, etc. 

### Types of N-Tier Architectures
There are different types of N-Tier Architectures, like 3-tier Architecture, 2-Tier Architecture and 1- Tier Architecture.


#### 3-Tier Architecture
3-tier architecture has three different layers, which are:

1. **Presentation layer (Presentation Tier):** The top-most level of the application is the user interface. The main purpose of the interface is to translate tasks and results to something the user can understand.
2. **Business Logic layer (Logic tier):** This layer coordinates the application, processes commands, makes logical decisions and evaluations, and performs calculations. It also moves and processes data between the two surrounding layers.
3. **Database layer (Data tier):** Here information is stored and retrieved from a database or file system. The information is then passed back to the logic tier for processing, and then eventually back to the user.


#### 2-Tier Architecture:
It is like Client-Server architecture, where communication takes place between client and server. In this type of software architecture, the presentation layer or user interface layer runs on the client side while dataset layer gets executed and stored on server side.

There is no Business logic layer or immediate layer in between client and server.
