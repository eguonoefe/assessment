# Motivation and  Commitment
### Expectation 
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of the team and is capable of motivating their team and maintaining their team's energy level and commitment throughout the course of a release or project.

### Justification
As the most experienced python developer present on my current engagement, I believe I have successfully portrayed this skill by: 

1. Taking lead in implementing extremely complex features and in so doing demonstrating to my team that they could as well take on big features regardless of their level of expertise.
2. Having pairing sessions with them, understanding blockers faced and talking through solutions on how to achieve their end goal or visualise the problem from some other perspective.
3. Stepping up during standups or retrospectives to propose ideas which I think the team could benefit from.
4. Public recognition and appreciation of their effort and commitment.
5. Constantly suggesting new technologies and how we could improve our current workflow.
6. Working with my team on a joint task. Being aware of what they are working on, and checking in on them to identify blockers and help unblock them.
7. Constantly improving my velocity to motivate other team members that they could as well do more.
