#Holistic Thinking

### Expectation
The Developer is able to understand the work that needs to be delivered by multiple members of a team, see how it all fits together toward the completion of a goal, and engage with stakeholders.

### Justification
On my current engagement and as a technical team lead on our properties service, I portrayed excellent holistic thinking abilities by:

1. When reviewing PR’s, I ensured that the code written are up to standard and follows the appropriate conventions. I also encouraged my team mate to write code that was extensible and reusable across the entire service and would scale with time.
2. I encouraged my team mate to model mock data in such a way that it wouldn’t be too much work when we actually switch to using the real thing.
3. When syncing with my team mate on pair programming sessions, I encouraged them to view the problem in such a way that they account for the intricate part of other functionalities.
4. When presenting stakeholders with possible solutions to a problem, I try to anticipate their responses as regards to their consideration of edge cases of the entire project.
