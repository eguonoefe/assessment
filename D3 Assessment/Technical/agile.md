# Agile Process
### Expectation
The Developer knows how to run daily stand ups, sprint planning sessions and retrospectives.

### Justification
On my current engagement, I have been able to acquire this skill as it is a routine on my team to take turns in anchoring daily standups, sprint planning and retrospectives. We run daily standups where each team member give updates about his/her current task and also state their blockers if any. We also have weekly sprint planning meetings, demo meetings and monthly retrospectives.
