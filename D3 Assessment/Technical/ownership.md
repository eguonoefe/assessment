# Ownership

### Expectation
The Developer takes full ownership of delivering all work outputs as well as managing the team to deliver on work outputs within defined timelines. They also strive to ensure consistent delivery by resolving conflict amongst team members.

### Justification
On my current engagement, I am the most experienced python developer on the team and the task of taking responsibility and management of deliverables for two of our services built with python mostly falls on me. I am also charged with reviewing pull requests, driving demos, taking and giving feedback, writing up tickets, taking a head on with handling issues, and being the first point with dealing with breaking changes and upgrades.
